# Steganography
 Project Description: Our group will create a program in C++ using the visual studio 2017 compiler that will hide an image within another image. The program will have the option to encrypt and decrypt an image file based on a single digit code from 0 to 8 (which will also act as numeric value for a shift operation). When encrypting - the program will ask the user for a file to hide and a file to use as the context data. In addition it will ask for a single digit encryption key. Then it will output an encrypted image file. When decrypting - the program will ask the user for an encrypted image and for the single digit encryption key. Then it will output a decrypted image in which the original image
